** December the 20th, 2016

ThesisPUC document class version 1.0.4 is released, the next maintenance
release for the 1.0 series.

*** Changes since 1.0.3

ThesisPUC document class now allows and fully supports thesis written in
English. Such thesis must declare their doccument class as this:

	\documentclass[
	  phd,
	  american
	]{ThesisPUC}

Notes:

	- In the above:

		master replaces phd for master thesis
		brazilian replaces american for portuguese thesis

	- The \title command must still hold the portuguese version of
    the title: it is used for the page 'Resumo'.

The tiny.tex example has been declared as a phd american english written
thesis (although we did not translate its chapters and conclusion
content): all front pages, their order when applicable, as well as any
automatically generated text are in English.


** October the 20th, 2016

ThesisPUC document class version 1.0.3 is released, the next maintenance
release for the 1.0 series.

*** Changes since 1.0.2

New commands
------------

This release add three new commands

	\catalogprekeywords
    \catalogprekey

	\usecolour

The first two commands are mandatory, the third is optional. Please read
their corresponding manual entry for a complete description, usage and
example.

Bug fixes
---------

	- a tipo has been fixed in both examples: a coma was missing in
      between the document class options in both examples, leading to
      the terrible side effect of not properly hyphenating the
      nonetheless specified Brazilian language;

	- abstract pages, both the brazilian and the english one, now
      have a proper indentation of their first paragraph;

	- the automatically generated catalog entry (ficha
      catalográfica) has been debugged and reviewed in order to satisfy
      the university library and publication rules;

	- the table of content listed an undesired entry, fixed.

	- the brazilian bibliographic references chapter title is now
      'Referências bibliográfica' (not 'Referências Bibliográfica'):
      note that it is recommended, by the PUC-Rio to only capitalize the
      first letter of the first word of chapter, secton ... entries.


Dependencies
------------

	- No changes, but it is recomended to grab the latest texinfo
      version, 6.3, if you locally (re)generate the documentation.
