	Abstract = {Although direct volume rendering is a powerful tool for visualizing complex structures within volume data, the size and complexity of the parameter space controlling the rendering process makes generating an informative rendering challenging. In particular, the specification of the transfer function-the mapping from data values to renderable optical properties-is frequently a time consuming and unintuitive task. Ideally, the data being visualized should itself suggest an appropriate transfer function that brings out the features of interest without obscuring them with elements of little importance. We demonstrate that this is possible for a large class of scalar volume data, namely that where the regions of interest are the boundaries between different materials. A transfer function which makes boundaries readily visible can be generated from the relationship between three quantities: the data value and its first and second directional derivatives along the gradient direction. A data structure we term the histogram volume captures the relationship between these quantities throughout the volume in a position independent, computationally efficient fashion. We describe the theoretical importance of the quantities measured by the histogram volume, the implementation issues in its calculation, and a method for semiautomatic transfer function generation through its analysis. We conclude with results of the method on both idealized synthetic data as well as real world datasets.},

We describe the theoretical importance of the quantities measured by the histogram volume, the implementation issues in its calculation, and a method for semi-automatic transfer function generation through its analysis. The techniques presented here make direct volume rendering easier to use, not only because there are much fewer variables for the user to adjust to find an informative rendering, but because using them is more intuitive then current interfaces for transfer function specification. Furthermore, the results are derived solely from the original dataset and its inherent patterns of values, without the introduction of any artificial structures or limitations. Examples with volume datasets from a variety of disciplines illustrate the generality and strength of the techniques.},

In this paper we present a multi-dimensional transfer function method for enhancing surfaces, not through the variation of opacity, but through the modification of surface shading. The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions. With our method, the user is given a means of visualizing boundaries without modifying opacity, allowing opacity to be used for illustrating the thickness of homogeneous materials through the absorption of light.},

These properties are used to define a transfer-function space which enables the distinction of different materials. Additionally, we present a novel approach for interacting with our new transfer-function space which enables the design of transfer functions based on statistical properties.

We propose a computationally efficient method for the automated detection of intensity transitions in volume data. In this approach, the dominant transitions correspond to clear maxima in cumulative Laplacian-weighted gray value histograms. Only one pass through the data volume is required to compute the histogram. Several other features which may be useful for exploration of data of unknown origin can be efficiently computed in a similar manner. The detected intensity transitions can be used for setting of visualization parameters for surface rendering, as well as for direct volume rendering of 3D datasets. When using surface rendering, the detected dominant intensity transition values correspond to the optimal surface isovalues for extraction of boundaries of the objects of interest. In direct volume rendering, such transitions are important for generation of the transfer functions, which are used to assign visualization properties to data voxels and determine the appearance of the rendered image. The proposed method is illustrated by examples with synthetic data as well as real biomedical datasets.},

The deployment of {DVR} in everyday clinical work, however, has so far been limited. One contributing factor is that current transfer function ({TF}) models can encode only a small fraction of the user's domain knowledge. In this paper, we use histograms of local neighborhoods to capture tissue characteristics. This allows domain knowledge on spatial relations in the data set to be integrated into the {TF}. As a first example, we introduce partial range histograms in an automatic tissue detection scheme and present its effectiveness in a clinical evaluation. We then use local histogram analysis to perform a classification where the tissue-type certainty is treated as a second {TF} dimension. The result is an enhanced rendering where tissues with overlapping intensity ranges can be discerned without requiring the user to explicitly define a complex, multidimensional {TF}},

A target distribution can reflect the data importance, or highly relevant data value interval, or spatial segmentation. Our approach is based on a communication channel between a set of viewpoints and a set of bins of a volume data set, and it supports 1D as well as 2D transfer functions including the gradient information. The transfer functions are obtained by minimizing the informational divergence or Kullback-Leibler distance between the visibility distribution captured by the viewpoints and a target distribution selected by the user. The use of the derivative of the informational divergence allows for a fast optimization process. Different target distributions for 1D and 2D transfer functions are analyzed together with importance-driven and view-based techniques.},

	abstract = {Transfer functions facilitate the volumetric data visualization by assigning optical properties to various data features and scalar values. Automation of transfer function specifications still remains a challenge in volume rendering. This paper presents an approach for automating transfer function generations by utilizing topological attributes derived from the contour tree of a volume. The contour tree acts as a visual index to volume segments, and captures associated topological attributes involved in volumetric data. A residue flow model based on Darcy's law is employed to control distributions of opacity between branches of the contour tree. Topological attributes are also used to control color selection in a perceptual color space and create harmonic color transfer functions. The generated transfer functions can depict inclusion relationship between structures and maximize opacity and color differences between them. The proposed approach allows efficient automation of transfer function generations, and exploration on the data to be carried out based on controlling of opacity residue flow rate instead of complex low-level transfer function parameter adjustments. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate the practical use of our approach in transfer function generations.},

	doi = {10.1109/TVCG.2016.2537341},
	abstract = {The 2D transfer function based on scalar value and gradient magnitude ({SG}-{TF}) is popularly used in volume rendering. However, it is plagued by the boundary-overlapping problem: different structures with similar attributes have the same region in {SG}-{TF} space, and their boundaries are usually connected. The {SG}-{TF} thus often fails in separating these structures (or their boundaries) and has limited ability to classify different objects in real-world 3D images. To overcome such a difficulty, we propose a novel method for boundary separation by integrating spatial connectivity computation of the boundaries and set operations on boundary voxels into the {SG}-{TF}. Specifically, spatial positions of boundaries and their regions in the {SG}-{TF} space are computed, from which boundaries can be well separated and volume rendered in different colors. In the method, the boundaries are divided into three classes and different boundary-separation techniques are applied to them, respectively. The complex task of separating various boundaries in 3D images is then simplified by breaking it into several small separation problems. The method shows good object classification ability in real-world 3D images while avoiding the complexity of high-dimensional transfer functions. Its effectiveness and validation is demonstrated by many experimental results to visualize boundaries of different structures in complex real-world 3D images.},

The method’s primary design goal is the correct and efficient handling of fluid interactions with curved boundary walls and internal obstacles. This is accomplished by the use of per-cell Jacobian matrices to relate field derivatives in the world and parameter spaces, which allows us to solve the Navier-Stokes equations directly in the latter, where the domain discretization becomes a uniform grid. We describe how to apply Jacobian matrices to each step of a standard regular-grid-based simulator, including the solution of Poisson equations using both Jacobi iterations and a Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized sparse matrix solver. The technique is implemented efficiently in the {CUDA} programming language and takes full advantage of the massively parallel architecture of graphics cards.},

	abstract = {Important engineering applications use unstructured hexahedral meshes for numerical simulations. Hexahedral cells, when compared to tetrahedral ones, tend to be more numerically stable and to require less mesh refinement. However, volume visualization of unstructured hexahedral meshes is challenging due to the trilinear variation of scalar fields inside the cells. The conventional solution consists in subdividing each hexahedral cell into five or six tetrahedra, approximating a trilinear variation by a piecewise linear function. This results in inaccurate images and increases the memory consumption. In this paper, we present an accurate ray-casting volume rendering algorithm for unstructured hexahedral meshes. In order to capture the trilinear variation along the ray, we propose the use of quadrature integration. A set of computational experiments demonstrates that our proposal produces accurate results, with reduced memory footprint. The entire algorithm is implemented on graphics cards, ensuring competitive performance.},

	abstract = {The exploration of volumetric datasets is a challenging task due to its three-dimensional nature. Segmenting or classifying the volume helps to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, but there remains the issue of searching through the feature space in order to find regions of interest. This problem is aggravated when the relation between scalar values and spatial features is unclear or unknown. To aid in the identification and selection of significant structures, interactive exploration methods are important, as they help to correlate the volumetric rendering with the scalar data domain. In this work, we present a semi-automatic method for exploring volumetric datasets using a graph-based approach. First, we automatically classify the volume from a 2D histogram, following ideas from previous proposals. Then, through a graph structure with dynamic edge weights, a hierarchy is generated to identify similar structures. The final hierarchy allows for an interactive and in-depth volume exploration by splitting, joining or removing regions in real-time.},
